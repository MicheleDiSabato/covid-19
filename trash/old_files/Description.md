# Covid-19 Pandemic

The COVID 19 pandemic required continuous monitoring by authorities due to several changes in the scenario that occurred. Predictive models of contagion evolution may be pivotal to making weighted decisions regarding actions to be implemented. In this homework, you will develop a physics-based or a data-based technique, allowing for the prediction of the pandemic trend in the following 7 days starting from daily acquired data.

Objectives of the homework:

1. **Step 1**: set up an automatic tool that accesses, updates and organizes the COVID-19 epidemiological data of Italy (on a regional basis);
3. **Step 2**: implement a strategy to update daily your prediction of the trend for the following days.

The prediction will involve the following categories (on a regional basis):
 1. new daily infections
 2. hospitalized
 3. recovered
 4. deceased.

The final score is determined as a function of the accuracy in predicting the actual trend.

Data can be extracted from the [database  dataset repository]( https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

Adopting an approach based on epidemiological models or neural networks will result in a bonus in the evaluation.
